Renting a new apartment or house can be exciting, but it's easy to make mistakes in the rush. Here are five common pitfalls to watch out for.

### 1. Not Reading the Lease Carefully
The lease is a legally binding contract. Before you sign, read every single word. Pay close attention to:
- The lease term (length)
- Rules on pets, guests, and alterations
- Penalties for late rent or breaking the lease

### 2. Skipping the Walk-Through
Document the property's condition before you move in. Take photos or videos of any existing damage, no matter how minor. Share this with your landlord in writing to ensure you're not blamed for it later. This is crucial for getting your security deposit back.

### 3. Forgetting Renter's Insurance
Your landlord's insurance covers the building, not your personal belongings. Renter's insurance is typically inexpensive and protects your property from theft, fire, or damage.

### 4. Not Understanding the Full Cost
Your rent is just one part of the monthly cost. Be sure to budget for:
- Utilities (water, gas, electric, internet)
- Parking fees
- Pet fees or deposits

Ask the landlord for an estimate of average utility costs if possible.

### 5. Ignoring Your Local Tenant Rights
Every city and state has laws that protect renters. These laws cover everything from how much a landlord can charge for a security deposit to the process for eviction. A quick search for "tenant rights" in your area can be incredibly empowering.

By avoiding these common mistakes, you can ensure a smoother, more secure renting experience.
