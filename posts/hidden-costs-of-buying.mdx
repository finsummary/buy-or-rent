## 1. Property Taxes
This is one of the largest ongoing costs. Property taxes are paid to local governments and fund public services like schools and roads. The amount varies significantly based on your location.

## 2. Homeowners Insurance
Your mortgage lender will require you to have homeowners insurance. This protects your investment against damage from events like fires, storms, or theft.

## 3. Maintenance and Repairs
From a leaky faucet to a new roof, unexpected repairs are a part of homeownership. A good rule of thumb is to budget 1-2% of your home's value for maintenance each year.

## 4. Utilities
If you're moving from a small apartment, be prepared for higher utility bills. Heating and cooling a larger space can significantly increase your monthly costs.

## 5. HOA Fees
If your home is in a community with a Homeowners Association (HOA), you'll have to pay monthly or annual fees. These fees cover the maintenance of common areas like parks, pools, and security.
