## 1. Check Your Credit Report
Before you do anything else, get a free copy of your credit report from all three major bureaus (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion). Dispute any errors you find, as inaccuracies can drag down your score.

## 2. Pay Your Bills on Time
Payment history is the single biggest factor in your credit score. Even one late payment can have a significant negative impact. Set up automatic payments to ensure you never miss a due date.

## 3. Reduce Your Credit Card Balances
Your credit utilization ratio—the amount of credit you're using compared to your total limit—is another key factor. Aim to keep your balances below 30% of your credit limit on all cards.

## 4. Avoid Opening New Accounts
Every time you apply for new credit, it results in a "hard inquiry" on your report, which can temporarily lower your score. Avoid opening new credit cards or taking out other loans in the months leading up to your mortgage application.

## 5. Keep Old Accounts Open
The age of your credit history also matters. Even if you don't use an old credit card anymore, keeping the account open can have a positive impact on your score's length and history.
